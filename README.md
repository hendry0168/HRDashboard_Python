## 💼 Why I Built This

As an HRIS developer in a real-world HR department, I saw the need for simple, real-time dashboards to support decisions by HR leaders. This project demonstrates my skill in:

- **Data engineering** (SQL function design, data modeling)
- **Backend/frontend integration** (Streamlit + SQL)
- **Business understanding** (HR metrics that matter)
- **Clean UI/UX** (cards, icons, and layout for non-technical users)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python)
- **Backend**: Microsoft SQL Server (SSMS), SQL Functions
- **Data**: Dummy HR data (onboarding, separation, demographics)
- **Visualization**: Plotly (bar charts, pie charts)
